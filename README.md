# Digital-Diary

This code is a simple effort to reiterate the pleasure of writing a diary on a regular basis but in a digital manner.This python code makes use of Tkinter to create a GUI(Graphical User Interface).The application offers three basic functions WRITE,READ and APPEND.The “WRITE” functions allows the user to type his/her thoughts just as he/she would have written in a physical diary.It also ensures to save the information you have typed in form of a text file in a remote folder in your local device.The “READ” ensures that the user could read what he had saved previously.If the user wants to edit the files the “APPEND” function comes to aid.The name of the files saved would be the date they are typed by the user.I did managed to a develop a basic password system which gives the power to control the application only by the user.With some basic python and Tkinter knowledge i suppose you could understand the code.
